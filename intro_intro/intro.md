# Introduction to programming

* What?
* Why?
* Who?
* How?

# What?

* Data analysis through coding - "data science".
* Simple programming with Python and standard Python libraries.
* Loading data.
* Selecting and exploring data.
* Plotting data.
* Simulation and basic statistical inference.

# Why?

* Programming has become a basic skill for research.
* Code makes data analysis more:
    * Powerful;
    * Shareable;
    * Reproducible;
* Code makes it easier to understand statistics.

# Who?

* Anyone
* You need have no experience with programming.
* Very little mathematics.

# How?

* Winter term.
* Monday 2-3pm : lecture / workshop - mixture of talk and work.
* Thursday 10-10am : lecture / workshop - ditto.
* Working on your laptop (or a class laptop).
* Coding a web browser (Jupyter notebooks).
* Assessments:
    * 4 x 5% homework assessments; template analyses to fill in.
    * 1 x 80% structured data analysis; several template notebooks with hints.
