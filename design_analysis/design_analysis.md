# Design and analysis

* What?
* Why?
* Who?
* How?

# What?

* We continue data analysis through coding - "data science".
* We explore topics by building analysis from basic components.
* Simple regression.
* Multiple regression.
* The nature of statistical inference.
* Predicting new values from old data.
* Confidence intervals.
* Finding the best values with optimization.
* Basic machine learning.

# Why?

* Expanding range of analyses using programming.
* Covering wider range of statistical tests (using same 'try it and see'
  approach).
* Relationship with traditional parametric tests.
* Should should become independent in data analysis:
    * Choosing the right analysis;
    * Finding help for understanding new problems;
    * Designing your own models to test new questions.

# Who?

* Programming / data analysis background from "Introduction to programming".
* Very little mathematics.

# How?

* Spring term.
* Tuesday 2-3pm : lecture workshop.
* Thursday 10-10am : lecture / workshop - ditto.
* Working on your laptop (or a class laptop)
* Coding in web browser (Jupyter notebooks) and with editor / command line.
* Good support from TAs.
* Assessments:
    * 10% x 2 coursework assessments; template analyses to fill in.
    * 80% advanced analysis project.  You chose your own data to analyse and
      your analysis approach.
